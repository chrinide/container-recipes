Main TODOs:

* Fix metadata in headers
* Convert Singularity to Docker + Singularity
* Stop using local image bootstrapping for code containers

Would-Be-Nice:

* Figure out why the OpenMP version of FFTW3 isn't found when
  installing Quantum ESPRESSO with OpenMP
* Figure out why RT-TDDFT runs are crashing in FHI-aims test
  suite
